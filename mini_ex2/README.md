Coding process.

My coding process waas very trial and error based. I had a clear idea what I wanted with the triangle but it really an idea how to do it 
so I started with looking at the p5js references and tried something looked at the result in the browser and try again. Usually it didn’t 
work because I had no idea where the coordinates were referring to so I had to keep readjusting until it was right.  

When the character was done I really wanted to give it something… more. Some interactivity of just something so it wasn’t just a static 
picture. I tried a bunch of stuff with the references but couldn’t get it to work. I tried making part of the triangle change colour when 
clicked but I ended up putting the definitions and choosing for the colours down in the draw section so it changed every time it loop, 
which it does a LOT! It was an error but since it worked perfect with the concept I wanted to make, I  made it into something I could use. 

Program.

A program is a series of instructions for a computer to run. 

Error.

To me an Error is a mistake, something that went wrong. An error has some sort of need to be corrected for something to work right. It’s a 
deviation from what is correct. Although many errors are so small that they are insignificant and therefore not worth correcting they all 
have in common that they are not supposed to be there. 

If the ”error” was made on purpose it was never an error. Then it might be a tool for learning or a glitch made for a game to make a 
different, more entertaining experience like in games. But errors that really were mistakes can also become tools we can use to learn or 
to point out even bigger problems.
