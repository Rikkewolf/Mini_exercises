<h3>Description</h3>
My program consists of different stages we go through when taking a new standpoint in life. 
The stages are called to the screen by pressing the appointed keys as shown. 
The stages loop (if the user presses the key in the right order) but the text changes colour to 
indicate when the new standpoint is reached and a new loop has started thereby providing feedback. 

When thinking about the self regulation of cybernetics my first thought was how we humans change the way we think 
about the world when getting feedback about our point of view from the world around us. This thought reminded me of the quote that became 
the titel of the program "You have a standpoint until you take a new one."
