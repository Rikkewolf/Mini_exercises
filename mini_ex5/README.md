<b>Description</b>

I only ended up using the sample code to express my frustration with the RiTa library.  
I couldn’t get the RiTa references to work. 
My program may seem a bit... unprofessional and I did consider making something different without RiTa but I had limited time left so whatever I could have made wouldn’t be very good. 
Besides, my frustration is the only proof of the work I put into trying to get it to work and since these exercises are for experimenting I felt it was appropriate to show it.  
I had planned to use the replaceWord function to change the word bee in the Bee Movie script with other stale memes. 

<b>Experience working with found text as the source materials</b>

My original idea was to work with the Bee Movie script and make a new version of the meme, "the bee movie but every time it says bee...". 
The idea to work with a meme intrigued me because of the whole idea that a text, or any other medium, can end of going viral and be seen by millions of people, way easier that ever before. 
It doesn't take a best selling book for a piece of text to become a substantial part of culture. 
Finding pieces of text worth reading is easy and lot of text is written everyday in forums and messages and blogs and writers 
are popping up left and right with great stories that they are ready to share 
and using some of all that as source material is like jumping into a very big sea of both very and not so interesting things. 

<b>The materiality of text/interface</b>

Don’t judge a book by it’s cover it a very good saying to teach to kids to help them learn to not judge others by how they look 
but in reality a book’s cover, the paper it’s printed on, whether or not it’s even printed on paper and really everything surrounding the way we access a text will have an effect on how we view the text itself. 
The text can be the same but reading a book and a text posted in an online forum is not.
We associate these two mediums differently and that means we look at the text we’re reading in different ways. 
Books are often seen as more trustworthy because they are harder to change without trace 
but one of the interesting aspects that I think we should get more used is the interactivity and changing of texts that electronic literature can provide. 
Books never go out of style simple because comparing a book to electronic literature can’t be recommended.
