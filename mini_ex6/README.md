</h3>

<h3> Rules of the program </h3>
ReLaX runs on the rules of growing and shrinking from the sample code. 
The program uses these to make a bunch of shapes expand and decrease in different intervals. 
Using the methods we learned when working with the throbber the program rotates some of the shapes at different speeds. 
Lastly the rule of expanding and decreasing is used to go through the colours of the HSB colour wheel to create a rainbow effect. 

<h3>Expression of generativity</h3>
In the article Generative Art Theory by Phillip Galanter, 
the author talk about how generative art is art that uses a system to complete the result, 
how complex systems contains a mix of order and disorder and how most audiences will tire of the overly ordered or disordered. 
RaLaX may seem a little chaotic at the very first glance but operates on a strict set of rules and with a random amount of shapes it creates patterns.  

<h3> Bonus </h3>
In this bonus program: A simpel madala generator (which actually was my original idea) you can see the different shapes used for ReLaX
