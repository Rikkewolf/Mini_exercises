Objects are very good way to organise code. It’s like make a character sheet for all the things you want on the screen. 
It’s very useful when you want to create a lot of the same thing for example: 
I keep thinking of the pieces of 2d grass you see in older 3d games to give the ground something more than just a texture. 
Well there are a lot of these little pieces and they all look the same so my guess is someone made an object out of this grass 
and placed it randomly. In such a scenario the object is incredibly useful. 
In the small programs I for example make the use for me is a little harder to see. 
I really like being able to make a line of code, check to see what it did and the see if I want to change parameters, 
and since my programs rarely exceed 100 lines of code keeping track isn’t really a problem. 
(For me at least, when having to work with others I might get in trouble.)
