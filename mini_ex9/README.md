To make the program work in the browser it is necessary to allow it to load the “unsafe” scripts. Don’t worry; I wouldn’t even know how to make a virus ;)

<h3>The API</h3>
I  choose the Giphy API. My original idea was to use an image API but getting it to work was too much for me. It made me realize that working with APIs isn’t as easy as Daniel Shiffman makes it look. 

<h3> The Process</h3>
I followed Shiffmans instruktions and only changed some parameters regarding how the gifs are shown.  

<h3>Big Data</h3>
Big data I find is a difficult topic because everybody has an opinion on it when asked yet very few of us think about it on a day-to-day basis. Big data can be extremely useful but because of the way it’s been capitalized it has ended up as a moral question. The problem as I see it is we don’t know exactly how much data we’re talking about, only that it’s a lot and that makes it a scary intimidating topic for most people.
